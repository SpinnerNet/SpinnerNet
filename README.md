## What is Spinner.Net?

Spinner.Net is more than a platform—it's a digital ecosystem that serves as the connective tissue for the [Bamberger Spinnerei](docs/BAMBERGER_SPINNEREI.md) project. Designed to support creating, teaching, and exchange, Spinner.Net enables people of all backgrounds to connect meaningfully in the digital world, regardless of technical proficiency, language, or culture.

Unlike conventional platforms that silo your data and fragment your digital life, Spinner.Net puts you back in control through personalized digital companions, unified access to your services, and absolute data sovereignty.

## Key Principles

### Data Sovereignty

Spinner.Net returns control of personal data to individuals:

- **You control who accesses your data** and when access can be revoked
- **Transparent permissions** show what's being shared and with whom
- **Granular controls** allow precise sharing based on specific needs
- **Local-first design** keeps your critical data on your devices with optional cloud sync
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** mediates access without requiring access to content

### Human-Centered Design

Technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around:

- **Personalized digital companions** that learn and grow with you
- **Technology that understands you** across languages and cultural contexts
- **Universal access** across all devices and form factors
- **Age-appropriate interfaces** that adapt to different life stages 
- **Accessibility by design** for people of all abilities

### Integration, Not Replacement

Spinner.Net works with your existing services:

- **Connect to services** you already use without replacing them
- **Unified experience** across fragmented digital services
- **Add value** to existing platforms through enrichment
- **Enhance privacy** across connected services

### Community-Powered Evolution

Spinner.Net grows through community contribution:

- **Open collaboration** on core platform components
- **Transparent development** with community governance
- **Knowledge sharing** across expertise domains
- **Continuous improvement** based on real-world use
