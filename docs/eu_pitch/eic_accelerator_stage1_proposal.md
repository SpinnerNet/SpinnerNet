# EIC Accelerator Stage 1 - Short Proposal

## ZEITSPARKASSE â€“ The AI TimeBank: Universal Time Banking Platform for All Ages (6-113)

**Program**: EIC Accelerator Open (HORIZON-EIC-2025-ACCELERATOR-01)  
**Applicant**: Peter Homberger  
**Requested Grant**: â‚¬350,000 (12 months)  
**TRL**: Current 5 â†’ Target 7

## THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

**500+ million Europeans lose control of their time to modern life's complexity.**

Current time management fails everyone:
- **Children (6-12)**: No playful structure, screen time dominates
- **Teens (13-25)**: Social media steals time, no life skills training
- **Adults (26-65)**: Work-life imbalance, family time vanishes
- **Seniors (65+)**: Isolation, complex interfaces, forgotten by tech

**Market failure**: Big Tech profits from stealing attention, not saving time. No solution serves the full human lifespan.

---

## THE SOLUTION (45 seconds)

**Zeitsparkasse**: A browser-based AI platform that transforms time management into an engaging, social experience through gamified time banking.

*Inspired by Michael Ende's "Momo" - helping people save their time from modern life's "grey men" and invest it in what truly matters: themselves, family, and meaningful connections.*

ðŸŽ¯ **Core Innovation**: 
- Hybrid architecture: All core features run offline. Cloud backup is opt-in, hosted in EU zones
- Local Edge AI (WebLLM) ensures complete privacy by default
- AI assistants that SAVE time: Automate tasks, structure days, reduce decision fatigue
- Gamified time banking: Earn ZeitCoins for meaningful activities AND time saved
- Age-adaptive interface: From playful (age 6) to sophisticated (age 113)
- Multi-generational connections: Grandparents share time wisdom with grandchildren

**How it works**:
1. **Morning Investment**: "Good morning Maria! Ready to invest in today? You have 24 ZeitCoins!"
2. **Activity Banking**: Complete activities to earn ZeitCoins (walk = 3 ZeitCoins, call friend = 5 ZeitCoins)
3. **Smart Compound Interest**: Maintain streaks to multiply ZeitCoins (7-day routine = 2x multiplier)
4. **Community Exchange**: Share time wisdom or help others to earn bonus ZeitCoins
5. **Evening Portfolio**: Review your "time wealth" and plan tomorrow's investments

   - Exchange: Trade ZeitCoins for features or donate to community
   
2. **Social Features**
   - Time Co-ops: Join groups with shared goals
   - Wisdom Exchange: Older users mentor younger ones
   - Community Challenges: "Most active neighborhood"
